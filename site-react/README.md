React + Aceternity UI scaffold

Quick start

1. cd site-react
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes

- This scaffold assumes a package named `aceternity-ui`. If the real package has a different name or requires a different import path, update `package.json` and `src` imports accordingly.
- We'll migrate components incrementally: buttons/forms first, then hero/nav, then projects and skills.
